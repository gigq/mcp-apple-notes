## ‚ö° Tips for Best Results

- Ensure your Apple Notes app is properly configured with iCloud
- Use descriptive titles for better searchability
- Include relevant tags when creating notes for better organization

## üîí Security

### Security Features

- **Command Injection Protection**: All AppleScript commands are executed using safe spawning methods that prevent shell injection attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are properly escaped before being passed to AppleScript
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation rules for all parameters:
  - Title: Max 255 characters, no special characters that could break AppleScript
  - Content: Max 50,000 characters
  - Tags: Max 20 tags, 50 characters each, alphanumeric only
  - Search queries: Max 100 characters, sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting (30 requests per minute per tool) to prevent abuse
- **Secure IDs**: Uses cryptographically secure UUIDs instead of predictable timestamps
- **Error Handling**: Error messages don't expose internal implementation details
- **Configurable Account**: Support for custom Apple Notes accounts via `APPLE_NOTES_ACCOUNT` environment variable

### Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Set custom account names instead of using the default:
   ```bash
   export APPLE_NOTES_ACCOUNT="MyCustomAccount"
   ```

2. **Access Control**: The MCP server runs with your user privileges. Ensure only trusted applications can connect to it.

3. **Audit Logging**: Monitor the server logs for unusual activity or repeated failures.
